Wow, just left Alarum and my brain's scrambled eggs. Ok so, first things first, the theater smell, mix of popcorn explosions and that stale carpet odor — gross. A backache from the uncomfortable seats, or maybe it was the tension from that endless chase scene, you know the one with the screaming and the flashing lights that felt like a rave drowned in horror. 

> This character, the lead, she was like a cat on caffeine, darting across scenes. Her desperation felt so raw, but then it got me thinking about that one time I lost my keys and had a miniature panic attack, which is nothing like fleeing for your life but somehow felt just as serious in the moment. So loud, the movie, just a constant alarum of noise, like an orchestra of car alarms synchronizing at 3 AM. 

Oh and the visuals, like, drank a can of neon paint and spat it all over the screen, but in a good way? Crazy colors swirling like someone mixed oil into water and said, hey let's watch a movie. Total sensory overload. Also, must remember to actually download the movie sometime, even though nada can replicate today's theater chaos at home. Everything was an assault—the sound, the colors, even the plot was like this layered lasagna of insanity, just kept adding more and more until it spilled everywhere. 

My fingers smell like butter and I'm pretty sure there's a piece of popcorn stuck in my hoodie. And that climax! God, it was like spinning your head really fast then trying to walk in a straight line. When everything seemed to finally converge, it just... veered left, like a goat suddenly deciding to moonwalk. Absolutely bonkers.

> Remember that guy in the back coughing? Laughed now and then, awkward moments, kicked my seat too but honestly was too buzzed from the film to care. Mention, dude, when are you finally going to watch the movie yourself? Give up on that old promise, or else I'll recite it scene by scene and bore you to tears.

Random thought, but lunch earlier tasted like cardboard and I miss real food. Gotta uninstall whatever my memory's holding onto from today, let new thoughts flood in. The movie? A tidal wave, but it leaves you drenched, cold and bewildered, but weirdly craving more.
